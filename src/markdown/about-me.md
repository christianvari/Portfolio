Hey there!

My name is Christian Vari and I'm a 24 years old italian Software Engineer. I graduated in Computer Science and I attended a Master in Blockchain and Cybersecurity.

Currently I'm working at HCL Technologies as a Software Engineer, and, in my free time, I'm dedicating myself to deepen some aspects of Blockchain and I am improving my skills in building on Ethereum.

I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
