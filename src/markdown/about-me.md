Hey there!

My name is Christian Vari and I'm a 25 years old italian **Software Engineer**.

Currently I'm working at HCL Technologies as a **Software Engineer II** and I'm contributing in the Blockchain cryptoverse as a **Blockchain Smart Contract Auditor** with my own company, Codezen, associated with Oak Security.

My main focus is on innovative technologies, blockchain and microservice architectures.
I have good skills in web development and Agile team management.

I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
