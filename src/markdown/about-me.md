Hey there

I’m **Christian Vari**, a {AGE}-year-old Italian **software engineer and security researcher** passionate about blockchain technology and distributed systems.

I’m the **Founder & CEO of Codezen SRL**, where I lead audits and research focused on **blockchain security**. I also serve as **Lead Security Researcher at Oak Security**, **Security Researcher at Zenith Security**, and **Chairman of Altairith Capital Holding SRL**.  
As a **mentor at DeFi Talents (Frankfurt School of Finance & Management)**, I enjoy helping the next generation of professionals grow in the Web3 space.

My work centers on securing **smart contracts, chain code, and protocols** across **Solana**, **Cosmos SDK**, **Polkadot/Substrate**, and **EVM** ecosystems. I spend most of my time analyzing complex systems, uncovering hidden vulnerabilities, and improving security processes through deep code understanding and research.  
My technical toolkit includes **Rust**, **Golang**, **Solidity**, **TypeScript**, **CosmWasm**, **Cosmos SDK**, **Substrate/Ink!**, **Solana/Anchor**, **Move**, **Soroban**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**.

Beyond security, I’m deeply interested in **microservice architectures**, **developer experience**, and how **AI-driven tooling** can assist security audits without compromising code quality or confidentiality.

When I’m not working on audits or research, I like exploring new places, building side projects, and helping teams design systems that are both scalable and secure.

If you’d like to get in touch, head to the [contact section](#contact) below, I’d love to hear from you.
