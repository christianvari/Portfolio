Hey there!


I am Christian Vari and I'm a student of Computer and Automatic Engineering at the "Sapienza" University of Rome. 

I completed a high-level training course on Blockchain (in particular Ethereum and Hyperledger) which allowed me to learn how to develop applications on these platforms. 
 
At the moment I'm working at HCL Technologies and, in my free time, I'm dedicating myself to deepen some theoretical aspects of the Blockchain and I am improving my skills in building back-ends on Ethereum.

I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love to hear from you!
